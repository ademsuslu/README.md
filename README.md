I worked in the Frontend field for 6 months, focusing on technologies such as JavaScript, ReactJS and Redux Toolkit, Mui. During this process, I advanced myself and gained significant experience in the field of customer relationship management (CRM). During this period, I gained experience in JavaScript, ReactJS and Redux Toolkit with the projects I developed ♥️
